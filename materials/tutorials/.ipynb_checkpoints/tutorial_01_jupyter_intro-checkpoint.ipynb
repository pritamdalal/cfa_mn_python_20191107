    "The purpose of this tutorial is to introduce you to Jupyter notebook files.  This file - the one you are currently interacting with - is a Jupyter notebook.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook format conveniently allows you to combine words/sentences, computer code, code output, and mathematical notation.  Some people spend a lot of time to creating beautiful and well organized notebooks books that are used for communicating analysis (e.g. *Python Data Science Handbook* is a collection of Jupyter Notebooks).  However, a vast majority of notebooks are used simply as a convenient interative programming environment.\n",

    "\n",
    "At its heart, a notebook is a series of *cells*.  There are two kinds of cells: 1) code cells that contain (usually) python code; 2) markdown cells which contain markdown or latex."
