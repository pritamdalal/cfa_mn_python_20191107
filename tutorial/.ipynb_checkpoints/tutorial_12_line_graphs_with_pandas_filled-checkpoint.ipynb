    "In this tutorial we begin our discussion of data visualization in Python.  As a first exercise in visualization, we graph various volatility-related time series which demonstrate features of stock market retruns.  In order to do this we utilize some of `pandas` built-in visualization tools.  These visualization tools are built on top of the `matplotlib` package.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike R, in which a single package (`ggplot2`) has become the de facto standard for visualization, in Python there are a variety of packages that form a visualization ecosystem.  The `matplotlib` package is the foundation of much of the modern plotting ecosystem, and many elements of this ecosystem can be thought of as a wrapper around matplotlib.  Such packages include `seaborn` (which we will discuss later) and also the visualization tools in `pandas` which we discuss here.\n",
    "\n",
    "The inspiration for `matplotlib` was the plotting functionality in Matlab.\n",
    "\n",
    "The API for `matplotlib` is fairly low level, which means you have to specify a lot of different things for each graph.  In practice this can be cumbersome for quick plotting.  Many of parts of the visualization ecosystem seek to simplify the creation of *standard* graphs, and this is true of the `pandas` visualization functionality."
